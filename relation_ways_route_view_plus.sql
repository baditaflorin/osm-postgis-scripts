/* #Example of Use: This is usefull when you want to produce statistics about the routes, 
the most used tags that are used in the routes, network, etc */

/* #TODO #FIXME
This will only load the ways, but usualy route relations are made out of ways and nodes.
In this form, this script will only load the ways, not the nodes */
