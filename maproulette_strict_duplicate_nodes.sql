/* #Example of Use: This is usefull when you want to search for duplicate nodes */
-- #Start Code

/* #TODO #FIXME
- This will only load the duplicate nodes that are part of a way. Will not search for single nodes.
- For now this will search for nodes that are closer then ~20-30 centimeters . You can tweak the setting by changing the x=10000*(trunc(st_x(geom)::numeric,4)) on the update menodes line

-- like nodes means that will copy the structure of the nodes table into the newly created menodes
create table menodes (like nodes);
-- we add into menodes everything that is already existing in nodes
insert into menodes select * from nodes;
-- we add 3 more column, for the x,y and the count   
alter table menodes add column x int,add column y int,add column cnt int;
-- We create a index for faster processing
create index xy on menodes using btree(x,y);
create index dups  on menodes using btree(cnt);

-- This creates a grid INDEX, simlifing the geometryies to fit within a specific grid.
